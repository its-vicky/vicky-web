        <div class="aboutus">
            <p>My website's about us page will only contain information about myself. It is very good that, as a developer, you should try to explain yourself. My life's journey is very different from my field of study. Because I am starting my learning stage in my village schools, which are government schools, and their teachers are not very good at speaking English; they only speak Marathi, which is my mother tongue, I don't have knowledge about this field. I have completed my 7th standard in government schools, and after that, I gave the admission to a private school in my village that is Shri Sant Goroba Kaka Vidyalay. Their teachers are the same here in England as those in government schools. So I start by learning in my mother tongue. I received an 84.60% on my tenth grade. This is a very proud moment in my life because I am the second student to top the class in that grade in the 10th standard. After I complete my 10th class of school, I choose the computer science field for my 11th class, but I can't understand what's going on in English because my English is not good and I can't understand it, which is why my grades are very low in my 12th class. But in my graduation, I received myself in English, which was a very good opportunity to get standing up to learn about computer science, so I gave BCS. This is my amazing journey.</p>
